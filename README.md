# nvim

This is the repository for my neovim configuration.

The configuration is originally placed in my dotfiles repository, but I realized that most of the changes came from neovim configuration. So I split it from [kakufile](https://github.com/Dephilia/kakufile).

## Usage

You can directly place the directory in `~/.config/nvim`, or you may get it from kakufile installation.
